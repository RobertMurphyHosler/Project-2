1.  Inventory System.
2.  3 more attacks for the player.
	2.1  Maybe use a sword slash.
	2.2  Maybe use a paralizing attack.
	2.3  Set up a posion attack.
	2.4  Need to figure out how to set up the ability set attacks to different keys.
	2.5  If figure that out, then figure out how to switch between attacks to have only one attack button and an attack switch button.
3.  4 different attacks for enemies.
	3.1  All have the same basic attack (counts as one of the 4 attacks).
	3.2  An attack for the ranged unit. Like an arrow or fireball.
	3.3  An attack for the close non tank unit. Maybe a quick slash of the hand instead of the base attack.
	3.4  An attack for the tank unit. Maybe give them a battle hammer for an attack.
4.  Make merchant able to actually sell player stuff.
	4.1  As it stands make it so the player can purchase more health.
	4.2  Then be able ot purchase stuff later if theres time later.
